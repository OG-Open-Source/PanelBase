# Do these

1. use catalogue best practices
2. using a considerable degree of modular design to ensure that each function can be used completely
3. using go 1.19 architecture, and supports Windows macOS Linux.
4. logging updates to README.md, using time instead of version number.
5. use full English editor for the programme, but use Chinese dialogue with me.
